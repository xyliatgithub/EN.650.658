# EN.650.658 Introduction to Cryptography Fall 2018

## Meeting Time:
12:00-1:15 pm, Tuesday/Thursday 

## Meeting Place:
Croft Hall G02

## Instructor:
Xiangyang Li (xyli@jhu.edu)

## Office:
Malone Hall 311

## Class Office Hours:
By appointment TBD

## Course Assistant:
Yu-Tsern Jou

## Course Information:
Cryptography has a rich history as one of the foundations of information security. This course serves as the introduction to the working primitives, development and various techniques in this field. It emphasizes reasoning about the constraint and construction of cryptographic protocols that use shared secret key or public key. Students will also be exposed to some current open problems.

## Textbook:
There are many helpful cryptography and mathematics textbooks. We will mainly use the books by Stallings and by Katz and Lindell. Also, there are lecture notes available online that you can use for reference. (Please check the old EN.600.472 website. Just google it on JHU website.)

## Use of Computer:
An open-source mathematics software called SAGE can be used for programming exercises. This free software is based on python and similar to Matlab and Mathematica.
- You can access http://www.sagemath.org/ for installation of this software.
- You need a virtual machine environment to run SAGE on Windows OS. Please use the free VirtualBox player. (Last time I tried: It will be much easier to set up an account and upload/download files through a NoteBook interface at “localhost:8000” on a browser outside the virtual machine.)

## Use of Course Website:
- You should have been enrolled in the BlackBoard course website for this course.
- Class notes, assignments, and announcements will be posted on the course website.

## Tentative Topics and Schedule:
- Introduction to cryptography
- Classical encryption techniques
- Basic principles of modern cryptography
- Perfectly secret encryption
- Computationally-secure encryption and pseudorandomness
- CPA and CCA
- Private-key encryption
- Block ciphers and operation modes - DES, AES
- Stream ciphers
- Public-key encryption – RSA, Diffie-Hellman
- Data integrity - message authentication codes and hash functions § Authentication - digital signatures

## Evaluation:
Students are evaluated for understanding of fundamental concept, proof, and implementation of cryptographic systems.
- Homework (60%) – Several assignments are a combination of question/answer, proof, and programming. The homework should be submitted by its deadline.
- Exams (40%) – Three open-book/notes exams. First Exam is 10% and the last two are 15% each. No computational aids and Internet access are allowed. No collaboration is allowed for exams.

## Grading:
A letter grade will be assigned according to this formula: A - 90% and above; B - 75% to 89%; C - 60% to 74%; D - 50% to 59%; F - less than 50%. Appropriate upward curving will be made as necessary.

## General Requirements:
- Be regular; do not fall behind on class materials. No make-up exam will be offered. If you should be missing from one class, please make arrangement with the instructor in advance.
- Discussion is encouraged for homework assignment. But you have to form your own solutions. Only typed or electronic reports (hand drawing okay for figures if necessary and legible) are allowed for homework.
- Each student has a responsibility to understand, accept, and comply with the university’s standards of academic conduct, as well as policies established by the school. For example, getting help from fellow students or helping others in examination will be a violation. Copying other students’ work or online materials, or quoting others’ work in report without contribution declarations, will be plagiarism activity.

## Ethics
The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by the Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy:
Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment, failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional or graduate schools when a cheater applies.
Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.
Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone else’s solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. However, you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required by the assignment.
If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your group projects must list everyone who participated. 

Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.

Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs, as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received.
On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: "I agree to complete this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials or device. [Signed and dated]". Your course instructors will let you know where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.
Report any violations you witness to the instructor.
