## EN650.601 Lab Assignment 2

### Secret-Key Encryption (40 pts)
In this [lab](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_12.04/Crypto/Crypto_Encryption/Crypto_Encryption.pdf), you will apply knowledge of block cipher modes of operation to find out some interesting facts and do experiments on crypto programming such as random number generation. You have to complete six tasks in this lab and submit a report describing your work and observation. The lab is one of the exercises in [SEED Project](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/index.html). It provides [Virtual Machine (VM) image](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/SEEDUbuntu12.04.zip) to simplify the setup of experimental environment. Please load this VM image with Virtualbox or VMware on your computer, and read the [User Manual](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu12_04_VM/Ubuntu12_04_VM_Manual.pdf) carefully before you start. 

### Lab Notices:
- You can use any image.bmp you found for task 3.2 as long as you can see the differences between ECB and CBC in encryption. Though [lena](lena_color.gif) is the standard testing image, it is not a good choice in this lab due to its complexity. Use some simple image that has large areas of same colors instead.
- There are various ways of launching GHex. One is to use the command ```ghex <file_name>```. 
- Please include screenshots, codes, IVs, keys you use in the report. 
- Take screenshots periodically and include it in your report. They not only serve as evidences of completion but also help the grader understand what you're trying to achieve. 


### Submission Instructions
- This assignment is due on November 18th (Sunday) by 11:59 PM. 
- You will work in a group (to be discussed in class) for this assignment.
- Submit your report at BlackBoard in one PDF file.
- Only one report is needed from a group. 
- Please list group members in your report explicitly. 
- Please type your solutions. In general NO hand-written report is accepted.
